# LazyLoading-script
A simple script in js that loads not visible images as you scroll

Usage: change tags <- img src="../yourimage.jpg"-/> to <- img data-src="../yourimage.jpg" -/> and the script should do the rest.

Script uses intersection observer and was inspired by this article: https://deanhume.com/lazy-loading-images-using-intersection-observer/

Feel free to use it in your projects ;)
